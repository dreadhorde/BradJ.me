While I can usually stumble my way through Spanish and French, German may as well have been Greek to me. In the airport this wasn’t an issue at all, of course, but I was relying on the Vienna underground to get to my hotel (which is already a bit of a crapshoot in many cities).</p><p>Vienna has a very convenient train that goes directly from the airport to the center of the city (Wien Mitte) which I took instead of a taxi, expecting that I would get to see a bit of countryside.  Unfortunately I didn’t see much of anything from the train.  From there it was a quick subway ride to the Volkstheater stop and then a five minute walk to the hotel.  It was more than a five minute walk for me, though, because I couldn’t read the street signs and went the wrong way.  I got a good look at the Parlament on the way though.</p><p>One thing I very much appreciated about Vienna’s underground was the way ticketing works. You buy your ticket at a kiosk as you would anywhere else (or on your mobile phone, as I did), and then you just walk onto the train you want. There are no turn-styles or anything between you and your train.</p><h3 id=\"sleepy-sight-seeing\">Sleepy Sight-Seeing</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><img src=\"/content/images/2016/12/IMG_4990-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-featherlight=\"/content/images/2016/12/IMG_4990-3.jpg\" class=\"right-img\"><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>When I arrived at the 25hours hotel I was able to check in, but my room wasn’t yet ready because it was only about 9:00am.  So, I dropped off my luggage at the desk and asked the helpful young lady working there for a map and some ideas for things to check out around the city.</p><p>The museum I was most interested in in Vienna is called Mumok, a modern art museum less than a five minute walk from the hotel.  I made my way over there and spent a couple hours exploring its six floors.  The top three floors were dedicated to a rotating exhibition that I can’t say I was much of a fan of, and the bottom three floors were filled with selections from the museum’s archives.  The museum building itself is a beautiful but imposing structure, with very dark and industrial interiors (other than the standard white art exhibit rooms). I enjoyed some of the more high-concept works I saw there, but I was most impressed by the paintings that were on display in the lower levels.</p><p>By the time I finished exploring the museum I was getting pretty tired, so I headed to the museum’s cafe and ordered a black coffee.  I still don’t know what I received but it wasn’t black coffee as I know it. It was very tasty, however.  Then I looked around the gift shop for a bit before heading back to the hotel. When I arrived the cleaning people were just finishing up my room so I headed up to the top level where it was located.  I was blown away by the room: it had floor to ceiling windows looking out onto the beautiful city, it was equipped with a full kitchen and a bluetooth speaker, and it had an extremely comfortable bed and heated floors in the shower. Frankly, it was the most comfortable room in which I’ve ever stayed. I’d recommend the 25hours hotel in Vienna to anyone. I immediately fell asleep.</p><h3 id=\"beer-me\">Beer Me</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><img src=\"/content/images/2016/12/IMG_5057-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-featherlight=\"/content/images/2016/12/IMG_5057-3.jpg\" class=\"right-img\"><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>When I woke up several hours later it was dark.  It was about 9pm and I wasn’t really in the mood to explore the city for a place to eat, so I headed downstairs to 1500 Foodmakers, the hotel bar and restaurant. It was pretty busy, but I managed to get a seat at the bar and flag down a waiter whose nametag said Nacho. A few minutes later I had a large bottle of Puntigamer, known as the “beery” beer.  That’s probably the best way to describe it; it’s about as generic tasting as beer gets. Disappointed in my choice but still thoroughly unable to understand German, I ordered a second. After that I had to ask the bartender for something a little darker and received a massive glass of Wieselburger Schwarzbier. It was much better.</p><p>Now fortified against the cold, I decided to do a little midnight exploring. The hotel is situated within a five or ten minute walk of three or four of the plazas that turn into Christmas markets all winter. I headed towards the nearest one, Rathausplatz, knowing that the market would be closed but expecting to get some dark and moody pictures of the fantastic architecture. Satisfied with the photos I’d taken and starting to lose feeling in my hands, I made my way back to the hotel.  Back in my hotel room, I fell asleep easily once again.</p><h3 id=\"day-2-a-little-exploring-a-lot-of-sleeping\">Day 2 — A Little Exploring, A Lot of Sleeping</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><img src=\"/content/images/2016/12/IMG_5203-Edit-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-featherlight=\"/content/images/2016/12/IMG_5203-Edit-3.jpg\" class=\"right-img\"><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I made it my mission before I even set off for Vienna to spend as much time as I could relaxing in complete comfort, and on Day 2 boy did I ever accomplish that mission. I spent much of the day in the hotel room dozing, watching the sun rise and fall, and listening to music on the bluetooth speaker. It was absolutely decadent.</p><p>In the morning, however, I got up in search of a good cup of coffee.  What I found was a small brunch place near the hotel called Ulrich, which was mercifully less crowded than usual due to it being the off season. Because I was a party of one, I was seated at a communal table, where I was later joined by two American girls from Boston and Los Angeles. We chatted for bit about what brought each of us to Vienna as I enjoyed my breakfast (the Full Monty, it was delicious), and then I headed back to my cozy hotel room.</p><p>After another fantastic nap, I headed to the Rathausplatz once again, this time to see the Christmas market. It was beautiful: a bustling little village of stalls selling all sorts of crafts and treats, couples walking by clutching warm drinks, and all under the beautiful buildings of the plaza. I warmed myself with a mug of Gluhwein (mulled wine) and searched for gifts among the stalls. Each Christmas market had its own Gluhwein mug design so I decided to try and acquire as many variations as I could. As I finished my steamy mug I made my way back to the hotel for a good night’s rest.</p><h3 id=\"day-3-city-exploring\">Day 3 — City Exploring</h3><!--kg-card-begin: html--><img src=\"/content/images/2016/12/IMG_5096-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" data-featherlight=\"/content/images/2016/12/IMG_5096-3.jpg\" class=\"right-img\"><!--kg-card-end: html--><p>I was lucky enough to wake up extremely early (perhaps because I had spent the bulk of the previous day napping), and got to take some fantastic photos of the Viennese sunrise from my hotel window.</p><p>When the sun had risen fully I decided to explore the area around the Museumsquartier.

I checked out the various museums and some shops, saw some strange buskers in horse head masks, and finally wound up at the Maria-Theresien-Platz, another nearby Christmas market. There I took some photos, grabbed another delicious mug of hot Gluhwein and trolled around looking for Christmas gifts for family and friends. The Maria-Theresien-Platz was one of my favorite plazas, surrounded by ornate buildings and with massive statues in the center. I returned to my room for another wonderful nap shortly thereafter.</p><p>Waking up in the evening again, I decided to find a local dive bar to grab some food and beer. There turned out to be one very close to Ulrich, where I had been for breakfast the day before, called Das Käuzchen. It was small and cozy and reminded me of smaller bars back home.  Many of the decorations on the walls were even in English. I ordered a beer by pointing at the drink of the man sitting next to me and settled into the great atmosphere. A couple beers later a guy at the bar struck up a conversation, noticing by my camera that I was a tourist.

Our portal simplified\nthat entire process and made provisioning and managing those assets much more\nstreamlined than it had ever been before.\n\nCollaborative Design\nOur design team worked directly with a design team from Verizon to ensure a\nconsistent experience with Verizon's other applications. We collaborated to\ncreate an interactive style guide from which developers could pick and choose\ncomponents. This atomic design allowed us to easily share code and design\nelements through the entire Unified Security Portal and made updating those\ncomponents more granular and less reliant on whole complex systems.","feature_image":null,"featured":0,"type":"post","status":"published","locale":null,"visibility":"public","author_id":"1","created_at":"2019-11-02 23:52:18","created_by":"1","updated_at":"2019-11-03 16:49:45","updated_by":"1","published_at":"2018-10-02 23:52:00","published_by":"1","custom_excerpt":null,"codeinjection_head":null,"codeinjection_foot":null,"custom_template":null,"canonical_url":null},{"id":"5dbe16ce45adfe4a3c2fd283","uuid":"81a0e455-d675-40c6-9adb-875af4af38c0","title":"Animation  Module — Decky, pt.2","slug":"animation-module-decky-pt-2","mobiledoc":"{\"version\":\"0.3.1\",\"atoms\":[],\"cards\":[[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<video autoplay loop src=\\\"https://giant.gfycat.com/WellwornPerfectKakarikis.webm\\\" class=\\\"right-video\\\"></video>\"}],[\"html\",{\"html\":\"<p>One quick note: Many of the example animations in this article have been slowed down to show detail.
